This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a face recognition system which detects the faces in an image given by the user. As the user, you can sign in or register which is made with a secure Postgresql database. The system will keep track of your credentials, hash your passoword, and send that information to the front-end with node.js. Finally, the front-end is made with React. By Henry Boisdequin
